#### * [week-5](week-5) :
1. count character with max. occurence in an array - O(n)
2. pair_sum - to find whether two elements exist such that their sum is equal to the given key element- O(n*log n)
3. common_element - to find list of elements which are common to two sorted integer arrays of size m and n - O(m+n)

#### * [week-6](week-6) : bfs / dfs
